This repo contains a boilerplate setup for spinning up 3 Docker containers: 
1. A MySQL 8 container for obvious reasons
2. A Python Flask container to implement a REST API
3. A Local AppSmith Server

## How to setup and start the containers
**Important** - you need Docker Desktop installed

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Create a file named `db_root_password.txt` in the `secrets/` folder and put inside of it the root password for MySQL. 
3. Create a file named `db_password.txt` in the `secrets/` folder and put inside of it the password you want to use for the a non-root user named webapp. 
4. In a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder with the `docker-compose.yml` file.  
5. Build the images with `docker compose build`
6. Start the containers with `docker compose up`.  To run in detached mode, run `docker compose up -d`. 

**To open Appsmith, navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser**
